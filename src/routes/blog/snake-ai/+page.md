There are countless ways to implement an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve a given task, such as playing a game.
This post is an exploration of a few approaches.

## The Task

As the "playground" for this exploration, I'm taking one of the simplest games I know: [Snake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>).
I put together a basic implementation of the game in Python for this purpose:

## AI 1: "By Hand"

One way to make an AI play Snake is to come up with an "explicit" algorithm on how the AI should act in each situation, and implement it such that it acts accordingly.
Of course, this category by itself has countless ways of implementing an AI by hand, ranging from a "dumb" snake that moves around randomly hoping to run into apples, to complicated algorithms simulating different futures and picking actions leading to the best outcomes.

Let's look at two different algorithms a Snake-playing AI might use.

### Path-finding

### "Optimal"

## AI 2: Reinforcement Learning

## AI 3: Evolution

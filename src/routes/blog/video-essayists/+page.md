    <title>Doga Tekin on Video Essayists</title>

</svelte:head>

# {title}

I spend a substantial amount of my time online watching video essays on YouTube. These are some of my favorite essayists and a few recommendations from each one's catalogue.

## Jacob Geller

Jacob has an unparalleled skill in making profound connections between seemingly disconnected concepts. His videos bring together real events, games, movies, politics, architecture, art and more to both give you things to think about, and to give you goosebumps with sharp writing and editing.

#### Recommendations

- [Games, Schools, and Worlds Designed for Violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usSfgHGEGxQ)
- [Does Call of Duty Believe In Anything?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtCV421T52s)
- [Why Do Horror Games Sound So Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aFfN4HtjEc)

## Action Button

Tim Rogers is in a league of his own with essays ranging from 3 hours to 10 hours. Don't let the runtimes discourage you though, I've yet to regret an hour spent watching Action Button. He appears to review video games, and he does, but always within the context and culture that surrounds the games, with a depth that boggles the mind.

You come out the other side of a Tim Rogers video not only entertained, but with appreciation for the game he talked about, video games in general, entire cultures, and Tim himself.

#### Recommendations

## Folding Ideas

Dan Olson can deconstruct financial scams, conspiracy theories, important events and internet trends all with an incredible clarity; and turn these deconstructions into entertaining movie-length videos. There is some reason to believe he played a part in "bursting the NFT bubble", so worth watching for this alone. His older content still certainly holds up as well, which offer thoughtful takes on filmmaking, specific movies, games, and more.

#### Recommendations

- [In Search Of A Flat Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44)
- [Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g)
- [A Lukewarm Defence of Fifty Shades of Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzk9N7dJBec)

## Hbomberguy

In addition to persuasive opinion pieces on media, Harry produces very deep and informative deep dives into both important and completely obscure things, always keeping them funny with a controlled but somewhat unhinged energy.

#### Recommendations

## Whitelight

What sets Whitelight apart for me is his writing and delivery. He does present well-thought out arguments and critiques of games, yes, but for me half the enjoyment of a Whitelight video is the prose, the beauty, the almost poetic cadence.

#### Recommendations

- [Driveclub: Playstation's Fallen Masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPGaYRIz3es)
- [A Serious Critique of Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha1rO0btVLU)

These are some of my favorite essayists and a few recommendations from each one’s catalogue.</p> <h2>Jacob Geller</h2> <p>Jacob has an unparalleled skill in making profound connections between seemingly disconnected concepts. His videos bring together real events, games, movies, politics, architecture, art and more to both give you things to think about, and to give you goosebumps with sharp writing and editing.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usSfgHGEGxQ" rel="nofollow">Games, Schools, and Worlds Designed for Violence</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtCV421T52s" rel="nofollow">Does Call of Duty Believe In Anything?</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aFfN4HtjEc" rel="nofollow">Why Do Horror Games Sound So Beautiful</a></li></ul> <h2>Action Button</h2> <p>Tim Rogers is in a league of his own with essays ranging from 3 hours to 10 hours. Don’t let the runtimes discourage you though, I’ve yet to regret an hour spent watching Action Button. He appears to review video games, and he does, but always within the context and culture that surrounds the games, with a depth that boggles the mind.</p> <p>You come out the other side of a Tim Rogers video not only entertained, but with appreciation for the game he talked about, video games in general, entire cultures, and Tim himself.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb-DtICmPTY" rel="nofollow">ACTION BUTTON REVIEWS Tokimeki Memorial</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnBKX_vdYQI" rel="nofollow">ACTION BUTTON REVIEWS Cyberpunk 2077</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw" rel="nofollow">action button reviews boku no natsuyasumi</a></li></ul> <h2>Folding Ideas</h2> <p>Dan Olson can deconstruct financial scams, conspiracy theories, important events and internet trends all with an incredible clarity; and turn these deconstructions into entertaining movie-length videos. There is some reason to believe he played a part in “bursting the NFT bubble”, so worth watching for this alone. His older content still certainly holds up as well, which offer thoughtful takes on filmmaking, specific movies, games, and more.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44" rel="nofollow">In Search Of A Flat Earth</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g" rel="nofollow">Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzk9N7dJBec" rel="nofollow">A Lukewarm Defence of Fifty Shades of Grey</a></li></ul> <h2>Hbomberguy</h2> <p>In addition to persuasive opinion pieces on media, Harry produces very deep and informative deep dives into both important and completely obscure things, always keeping them funny with a controlled but somewhat unhinged energy.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BIcAZxFfrc" rel="nofollow">Vaccines and Autism: A Measured Response</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twDETh6QaI" rel="nofollow">ROBLOX_OOF.mp3</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkoGBOs5ecM" rel="nofollow">Sherlock Is Garbage, And Here’s Why</a></li></ul> <h2>Whitelight</h2> <p>What sets Whitelight apart for me is his writing and delivery. He does present well-thought out arguments and critiques of games, yes, but for me half the enjoyment of a Whitelight video is the prose, the beauty, the almost poetic cadence.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPGaYRIz3es" rel="nofollow">Driveclub: Playstation’s Fallen Masterpiece</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha1rO0btVLU" rel="nofollow">A Serious Critique of Minecraft</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e_zNLyEReg" rel="nofollow">Mirror’s Edge: 13 Years Later</a></li></ul> <h2>Carlos Maza</h2> <p>Carlos makes funny and easy to consume political videos without compromising at all on the informative or argumentative value.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJaE_BvLK6U" rel="nofollow">How To Be Hopeless</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMzIzk6xP9o" rel="nofollow">What The Hell Is “Too Far Left”</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG37wwhbS88" rel="nofollow">Coronavirus And America’s Death Cult</a></li></ul> <h2>Innuendo Studios</h2> <p>Whether applying art theory to analyze games or deconstructing the psychology and rhetorical strategies of the alt-right, Ian’s videos are always engaging and convincing.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmTUW-owa2w" rel="nofollow">This Is Phil Fish</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N6y6LEwsKc" rel="nofollow">The Artist is Absent: Davey Wreden and The Beginner’s Guide</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g" rel="nofollow">The Alt-Right Playbook: How to Radicalize a Normie</a></li></ul> <h2>Just Write</h2> <p>Sage has been making high quality essays consistently for many years now.

B. Cooper</a></li></ul> <h2>Leo Vader</h2> <p>In my opinion, Leo is simply one of the funniest people on YouTube and keeps coming up with very “Leo Vader” video ideas and executing on them perfectly. The one non-silly video he has is also amazing.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfdls1fqJE" rel="nofollow">were the magicians in Now You See Me wizards or what?</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZuxvWymdPY" rel="nofollow">how much would a PS5 cost in “In Time” time?</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jaWvHVMGik" rel="nofollow">when you slip on a banana peel</a></li></ul> <h2>NakeyJakey</h2> <p>Jakey has an infectious energy that makes it entertaining to watch him talk about anything.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMZ4kkSVrBw" rel="nofollow">Illegally Downloading Music</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvey_FjtXA" rel="nofollow">Flash Games Mattered</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLcRDRO_erI" rel="nofollow">Horror in Video Games</a></li></ul> <h2>Nerdwriter1</h2> <p>Evan engages with art and media in a way I hope I could as well, but at least I can see what that would feel like through his YouTube channel.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gksxu-yeWcU" rel="nofollow">Passengers, Rearranged</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aFo_BV-UzI" rel="nofollow">How Donald Trump Answers A Question</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z18LY6NME1s" rel="nofollow">Arrival: A Response To Bad Movies</a></li></ul> <h2>Nick Robinson</h2> <p>Nick somehow turns admittedly silly video ideas into great stories, and often fits in a trip to Japan in there as well.</p> <h4>Recommendations</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC8QoRa8y_Q" rel="nofollow">This Is What a “Second-Person” Video Game Would Look Like</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2RytpvQ9BA" rel="nofollow">Domino’s App feat.
